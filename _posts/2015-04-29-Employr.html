<h6>Swipe right on resumes.</h6>
<p>With Employr, job seekers and posters get a quick look at what the other has
  to offer, and match via the time-honored method of swiping right and left. If
  you both swipe right, you can chat and set up an interview!</p>
<p>Tag yourself or your hiring organization with different interests,
skills possessed or desired, and then swipe left or right at potential matches
for employment. If you both swipe right, message them and set up an interview.
Geographic filters allow for hiring in offices, remotely, or for small community
organizations and local businesses. Resume previews show only a summary of
skills and experiences, so the initial review process is equitable and
un-biased, with no HR overhead.</p>

<p>Local small non-profit owner / my neighbor says:</p>
<p><blockquote>
  I would definitely use Employr to help for hiring. I run a small non-profit
  that puts on dance classes for kids in the neighborhood and performs at
  festivals around Brooklyn. I post online, do a lot of word-of-mouth, and put
  up flyers when I need to hire for a position or a particular event. I would love to be able
  to set interests (like "dance, nonprofit, local") and set the range to "5
  miles", and find good people committed to the community. Sounds amazing!
</blockquote></p>
<p>Well, sorry, it's not amazing yet, because I haven't built it. But I think it's
a cool idea and maybe I should make it. At the very least, now it has its own
project page.</p>
