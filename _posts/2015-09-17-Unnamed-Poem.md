<samp>
roof shingles<br>
not mine<br>
but Someone's<br>
home and comfort<br>
not here<br>
but Somewhere<br>
there's peace and quiet<br>
not for all<br>
but For me<br>
foreign streets still welcome<br>
not loving<br>
but Relenting<br>
to power and force<br>
and Will to dominate<br>
these parks and harbours and proud others<br>
not strategic allies<br>
but Sisters and brothers We see<br>
when we look believe<br>
when they speak give up our<br>
day Off to fix the leaky roof<br>
or Give up our distance and our<br>
exclusion and our comfort<br>
so They may know the<br>
peace We covet because life is short and memory is long--<br>
or life is long and memory is short--<br>
who can remember?<br>
we give up our comfortable beds to<br>
another or for the stepping out we have<br>
chosen not to take, chosen not<br>
to See the textures, the wrinkled<br>
faces and cracked shingles of<br>
brothers and sisters We forgot<br>
