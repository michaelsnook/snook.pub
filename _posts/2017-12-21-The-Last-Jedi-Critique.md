I loved how the new Star Wars defied old tropes, weaved new themes about the Jedi and the Force, and had important character arcs that weren't the sort of typical (white dude, with a couple tokens) cast that most movies present to us. My problem was that I just didn't think it was a very good movie in terms of telling a well-constructed story that moved us along, made sense, and created character interactions and character development that track to the developments in the plot. 

When you look back at the movie, you find that major chunks of the action could have been cut out entirely without affecting the plotline, which kind of cheapened whatever character development happened during those parts. Much like my issue with _Rogue One_, a lot of the drama was about uncertainty between protagonists – which can be great if done well, and if it heightens the tension as you lead up to some climactic moment – but seemed too often to lead to some kind of anticlimax. When two opposing forces bring us to edge-of-your-seat suspense and the real fear about what might happen if something goes wrong, that's drama! When two opposing forces just kind of cancel each other out and negate whatever has been happening for the last few minutes (or last hour), that's not good filmmaking. 

Some of the characters and character developments came across this way too – you have conflicted or contradictory characters, not because the person is an "antihero," or a "bad person with a heart of gold," or they committed a crime to feed their family, or due to past traumas they are now visiting traumas on others to achieve safety, or because they're overzealous in pursuit of the good, or  they're the scoundrel who saves the day anyway... but just because we weren't sure if we should like them a lot. Or maybe for a moment we liked them and then later changed our minds, or vice versa. Simply creating characters that aren't all good or bad isn't particularly dramatic – you have to create conflict and allow that conflict to play out in the plot of the story! Here are a couple of examples from previous _Star Wars_ movies:

1. Vader is bad, but he loves his son, so he doesn't kill him and eventually betrays his master to save him. This character conflict leads to conflict in the plot and results in moments where the plot arc changes dramatically because of a change in the character's resolve or his loyalty. The conflict in Vader is not just indecision but _acting_ in one direction and then _acting_ in another.
2. Lando Calrissian is an old friend of Han's, but he has lost his sense of loyalty; under duress he betrays our heroes, but when he realizes there's no point trying to placate the Empire he decides to save them. Also _very important_ for driving the plot forward. The discovery that Lando has betrayed them actually rewrites our understanding of what had been happening for the last 20 minutes; we, the audience also feel betrayed and lied to because we thought this was a safe space. The character conflicts in _The Last Jedi_ never seem to build up this kind of "trust that gets pulled out from under us". We just have some conflicted bad guys and some conflicted good guys. 

I'm not naming names here, but I felt this way about 2 or 3 different characters and 1 or 2 major character developments throughout the film. For a story that has around a dozen important characters, this is a major chunk of the movie falling flat. 

I won't list them here (for spoiler-avoiding purposes), but there were a few important relationships that could have been deepened and drawn upon throughout the story, but weren't, so when the moment came for the relationship to really show up on stage, it lacked emotional weight. I saw what was happening in a sort of cold way. "Ahh right, this person feels this for/about this other person and feels the following emotions about what has just transpired." But I wasn't really feeling the emotions myself. 

There were a few times I really felt the Star Wars tingles running down my spine. But to be honest, some of the jokes and the attempts at humor really broke it for me. Some moments that should have been sacred were interrupted with what seemed like an attempt at Guardians Of The Galaxy-type lightheartedness. Just when I thought I was getting into it... nope. The Jedi are a religious order 1,000 generations old, but this movie didn't really seem to care, and I really never got close to feeling the sense of wonder I experienced as a boy watching Luke channel the force for the first time. So there was no Jar-Jar and barely a peep from C3PO; great. What we got instead is the Last Jedi in the galaxy cracking jokes during training. Is this any better? 

All in all, I finished the the movie pretty bored. I'm happy that we have some story lines where Black and asian characters -- and plenty of women -- have their own worth, their own authority, their own meaning. But I'm left feeling like... what a low standard we have set for ourselves, that in 2017 I have so few sci-fi and fantasy movies to choose from that we have to choose between well-crafted storytelling and characters more representative of the world we live in.
