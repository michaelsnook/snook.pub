It's an app, like Google Reader morphs into the morning news hour on the Radio.
Take RSS feeds, your Medium follows, and any podcasts you like. Run text-to-speech on the
stories (or on platforms like Medium where
sometimes there's an audio accompaniment built in, just grab that). And play the morning news
in audio format, using your favorite sources, but in a comfortable audio format so you can
listen while getting ready for the day or getting on the subway.

Does this exist? An RSS-feed-TTS-morning-news-app? If we were coming up with one today...
I would call it... Radiyr.
